# Spring Boot API Project

## Why are we doing this?

To create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during the 9 week software development bootcamp.
Specifically, I am required to create a Spring Boot API using:
* an application back-end developed using the language from your Programming Fundamentals module (e.g. Java)
* a managed database hosted locally or within the Cloud Provider examined during your Cloud Fundamentals module (e.g. H2 or MySQL (local / GCP)
* a means of making API calls (Postman) and a means of checking persistence (Workbench/H2 console)


## How I expected the challenge to go.
I thought that we had a reasonable timeframe to complete the project and that it was relatively simple. I expected to have plenty of time to do testing at the end.

## What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
The project as a whole went quite well. I was able to write the code and use Postman to send HTTP requests. Now that I have more experience with using the feature branch model, the next project I do I will be able to incorporate it more effectively. The part I struggled most with was the testing as it is something I need a more time and practice on.

## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
If I went back over this project in the future I would add more tests and go look into the folowing stretch goals:
* Use custom queries, such as ‘find by name’.
* Include custom exceptions in your service.
* Include the use of DTOs
* Include the use of Lombok
